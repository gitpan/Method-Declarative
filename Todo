TODO list for Perl module Method::Declarative

- Rewrite the module creation code to compile a more complete method
  closure - the current implementation just sticks all of the parameters
  into arrays and wraps a call to do_method in a closure, passing all of
  the arrays in as arguments.  It would certainly be faster if I could
  unroll the loops and put `em all into a whoppin' big subroutine that's
  generated on the fly.

- Do a better job of cloning the passed-in data structures.  Current
  copies are only two levels deep, and could cause some amusing results if
  the data structures are changed out from under us.
